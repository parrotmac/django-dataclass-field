# django-dataclass-field

A simple and efficient way to have a typed Django JSON field using Dataclasses. Under the hood, it leverages the power of `dacite` to bring the magic of dataclasses to your Django models.

## Features

- Use Python's built-in dataclasses as a field type in Django models.
- Automatic serialization and deserialization using `dacite`.
- Strongly typed structure for your JSON fields simplifies working with JSON data in Django.

## Installation

### 1. Install the Package

Install the `django-dataclass-field` package via pip:

```
pip install django-dataclass-field
```

### 2. Update Django Settings

#### Update `INSTALLED_APPS`

Add `'django_dataclass_field'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in your Django project's settings:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_dataclass_field',
    ...
]
```

#### Update `TEMPLATES` Setting

Ensure that the `APP_DIRS` setting within the `TEMPLATES` configuration is set to `True`. This setting tells Django to look for templates in each app's `templates` directory:

```python
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        ...
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        ...
    },
]
```

### 3. Usage

With the package installed and settings updated, you can now proceed to use `DataClassField` in your Django models. Refer to the "Usage" section of this README for detailed examples and guidance.

## Quick Start

Let's consider a car-themed example. Assume you have a dataclass `Car`:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Car:
    brand: str
    model: str
    year: int
    color: str
```

Now, if you want to store this data structure in a Django model, you can simply use `DataClassField`:

```python
from django.db import models
from django_dataclass_field.fields import DataClassField

class CarModel(models.Model):
    car_data = DataClassField(Car)
```

With the above, the `car_data` field will automatically serialize instances of the `Car` dataclass into JSON when saving to the database, and will deserialize the JSON back into an instance of `Car` when reading from the database.

That's it! You're ready to bring strongly typed JSON fields into your Django projects. Happy coding! ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Following the earlier example, you can easily create new instances of `CarModel`:

```python
new_car = CarModel(car_data=Car(brand="Toyota", model="Prius", year=2022, color="red"))
new_car.save()
```

Retrieving the instance will give you access to the `Car` dataclass:

```python
retrieved_car = CarModel.objects.get(id=new_car.id)
print(retrieved_car.car_data.brand)  # Outputs: Toyota
```

### Querying

You can query the fields as you would with any other Django JSON field. For instance, to find all red Toyotas:

```python
red_Toyotas = CarModel.objects.filter(car_data__brand="Toyota", car_data__color="red")
```
